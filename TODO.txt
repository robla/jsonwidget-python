Things to get done before version 0.1

On deck:

Roadmap
0.1.0:
*  Disable the "delete" option when a field that can't be deleted is selected
**  Ensure that "delete" over "add fields" area doesn't cause crash
**  Provide alert "foo is a required field"
*  Fix crashing problem with deleting whole address entries in address book
*  Remove hardcoded 20 character label column
*  Remove hardcoded 13 character "Add field" button width
*  Put "Add field" over in the data area
*  Change "add fields" to "add items" for sequences
*  Add alias for editing address books
*  Minimal check for urwid and simpleparse (and look for /etc/lsb-release to 
   figure out the right error message)

0.1.1:
*  Implement ability to edit arbitrary JSON
*  Highlight all children when deleting
*  Preserve key order in json files when saving

0.2.0:
*  Update to urwid 0.9.9 mainloop
*  Remap ctrl-s, ctrl-q, ctrl-c, etc
*  Look at SitePen internet draft to see if compatibility is feasible

Someday maybe:
*  Implement undo/redo stack
*  Implement "File exists.  Overwrite?"
*  Implement immediate filename prompt when write fails
*  Implement read-only flag

Done:
*  Basic editor
*  Change schemaNode to schemanode
*  Make jsonedit populate the data
*  Break up jsonedit.py into jsonedit, jsonforms-urwid.py and jsonschema.py
*  get rid of wrapEditFieldWidget (roll into getEditFieldWidget)
*  Fix up the schema data structure
*  Create function to get the unused fields
*  Put valid field names on buttons
*  Make the button display a list
*  Saving json files
*  Implement ability to add child nodes
*  Fix deep mod problem 

    def setChildData(self, key, data):
        self.data[key]=data
        # add this line:
        self.parent.setChildData(self.key, self.data)
   This will probably bomb out at the top level....figure out how to mitigate
   that.
*  Figure out why running with no params fails
*  Implement title bar at top
*  Implement help panel on bottom
*  Implement "save"
*  change API of GenericEditWidget to only initialize with a valid JsonNode
*  Update data for booleans and enumerations
*  Look up proper doc format for python comments, and start using it.
*  Adapt browse.py from urwid into reusable TreeWalker component, and use that
*  Implement ability to delete child nodes
*  Don't render "Add field" row if there's no fields to add
*  Use schema key order in editor
*  Autopopulate required fields with blank data
