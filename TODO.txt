Roadmap for future versions

There's no firm roadmap for features right now.

On deck:
0.1.7
*  Consolidate several modules into jsonwidget/__init__.py

next version (e.g. 0.1.x):
*  "Space" and "enter" should toggle expand/collapse on parent nodes
*  Implement ability to edit arbitrary JSON
*  Highlight all children when deleting
*  Preserve key order in json files when saving
*  Add a schema selection menu
*  Add support for configuration files (look into ConfigObj)
*  Only highlight the "Add Field" buttons rather than the whole row
*  Add ability to load schema from string buffer (so that an ordermap can be 
   generated)

next major version (e.g. 0.2.x):
*  Update to urwid 0.9.9 mainloop
*  Remap ctrl-s, ctrl-q, ctrl-c, etc
*  Look at SitePen internet draft to see if compatibility is feasible

Someday maybe:
*  Package for Debian
*  Package for Fedora
*  Implement undo/redo stack
*  Implement "File exists.  Overwrite?"
*  Implement immediate filename prompt when write fails
*  Implement read-only flag
*  Put "Add field" over in the data area
