"""
Library for generating a user interface from a JSON schema.

This library allows an application developer to provide a curses-based user 
interface for an application using not much more than a JSON schema.  The 
JSON schema language is described here:
http://robla.net/jsonwidget/jsonschema/

However, most people will find it much simpler to use a tool to generate a 
schema for tweaking.  The tool available here will generate a schema from an
example piece of JSON, and allow editing the resulting file:
http://robla.net/jsonwidget/example.php?sample=byexample&user=normal

This library currently only operates on a subset of JSON files, but a near-term
goal is to allow editing of any arbitrary JSON file.

Usage:
    import jsonwidget
    
    foo = "foo.json"
    fooschema = "fooschema.json"
    jsonwidget.run_editor(foo, schemafile=fooschema)
